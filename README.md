Here we go with the second Cyber Secruity Task which is an "IMAGE ENCRYPTOR" using Python.

This project implements a basic Image Encryption tool using Python. Image encryption is the process of hiding images from unauthorized access using a secret key. Encryption is performed by applying XOR operation to each pixel of the image.

Features :-
1. Encrypt images by applying XOR with a specified key.
2. Decrypt Encrypted images using the same key.
3. Supports common image formats (Eg:- PNG , JPEG).
